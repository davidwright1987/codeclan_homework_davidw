Extension

A lot of Excel sheets you will encounter will contain more than one sheet. Try to write some code that reads in all the different sheets in the file green_bindle_consulting.xlsx.

[Hint: you will need to write a for loop]

```{r}
library(openxlsx)
library(readxl)
```

(Code from stack overflow but struggling to get tibble to work)

```{r}
read_all_excel_sheets <- read.xlsx("data/green_bindle_consulting.xlsx", tibble = FALSE) {}
sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets("data/green_bindle_consulting.xlsx")
    x <- lapply(sheets, function(X) readxl::read_excel("data/green_bindle_consulting.xlsx, sheet = X)
    if(!tibble) x <- lapply(x, as.data.frame)
    names(x) <- sheets
}


```

```{r}
my_sheets <- read_excel_allsheets("data/green_bindle_consulting.xlsx")
```
