Jabberwockies sleep for around 7 hours a night, on average. Perform an appropriate statistical test to determine whether the mean sleep_total in the sampled population of animal types differs from the typical value for jabberwockies.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  summarise(mean(sleep_total))
```

```{r}
omni <- msleep %>% 
  filter(vore == "omni")
omni

herbi <- msleep %>% 
  filter(vore == "herbi")
herbi

mean(herbi$sleep_total)
mean(omni$sleep_total)
```

```{r}
msleep %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = vore, y = sleep_total)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
Perform an appropriate statistical test to determine whether the proportion of domesticated animal types in the population of animal types is greater than 5%.
[Hint - think about creating an is_domesticated variable for the analysis]
```{r}
domesticated <- msleep %>% 
  filter(conservation == "domesticated") %>% 
  mutate(is_domesticated = "domesticated")
domesticated
```

```{r}
msleep %>% 
  mutate(is_domesticated = ifelse(conservation == "domesticated", "TRUE", "FALSE")) %>% 
  group_by(is_domesticated) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())
```
